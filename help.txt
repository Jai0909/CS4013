The L4 Hotels Reservations system is a Character User Interface based system.
The system's primary objectives include booking a room, checking room vacancy, etc.
To compile the system you will first have to download the zip file from the GitHub repository given below.
Next, you must unzip the file in your desired location.
After you unzip the folder on your machine you must open Command line(Windows) or terminal(macOS or Linux)
Now you must go to the directory where you have unzipped the code. For example, if we unzip the code on Desktop the command would be "cd Desktop/CS4013PROJECT-main"(works the same in both cmd and terminal).
Once you are inside the directory perform the following command "javac *.java"(works for both cmd and terminal)
There will not be any errors and then you can move on to run the program.
To run the program simply type "java Root"(works for both cmd and terminal)
Here root is the name of the main file of the system. You must not change this name.
Sometimes the command "java Root" might not work if so you can use the following command "java -cp . Root".
Since this is a CUI-based system you would not require any JavaFX modules while compiling or running the program.
